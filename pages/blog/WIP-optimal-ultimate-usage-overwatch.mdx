- What is the optimal frequency to use your ultimate at?
- Assumes no synergy between ultimates
- Ultimates have intrinsic value (Expected number of kills)
- Time value decays over time while ultimate is unused
- Value taking decay into account over one half-life is 0.5 * expected number of kills
- Why 0.5? Because it's the time it takes to charge a 2nd ultimate,
therefore the expected value of it needs to double
- Equations for modelling value (t and ult charge in sec):
- Asymptotic: vr = vi / ((t / ult charge) + 1)
- Exponential decay: vr = vi * e^(-(ln(2) / ult charge) * t)
- Inverse decay equations to see what the required value at t is to equal expected value
