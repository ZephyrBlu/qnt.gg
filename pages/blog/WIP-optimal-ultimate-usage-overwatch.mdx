Assumptions:
- Assumes no synergy between ultimates (I.e. whole is greater than sum of it's parts)
- Assumes that the goal of using the ult is kills (I.e. offensive ults)
- Assumes that optimal ult usage revolves around expected value
(I.e. use it instead of saving for a play. Not necessarily true, momentum-related usage can be more impactful than value-related usage)
- Assumes that optimal ult usage is more than having the ult available
(I.e. better to use it now than save it for a dire situation. Not necessarily true for all ults)

Assumptions mostly narrow down to offensive ultimates that are supposed to generate consistent
value like Soldier's Tac Visor.

- What is the optimal frequency to use your ultimate at?
- Ultimates have intrinsic value (Expected number of kills)
- Time value decays over time while ultimate is unused
- Value taking decay into account over one half-life is 0.5 * expected number of kills
- Why 0.5? Because it's the time it takes to charge a 2nd ultimate,
therefore the expected value of it needs to double
- Equations for modelling value (t and ult charge in sec):
- Asymptotic: vr = vi / ((t / ult charge) + 1)
- Exponential decay: vr = vi * e^(-(ln(2) / ult charge) * t)
- Inverse decay equations to see what the required value at t is to equal expected value
- Calculate vi based on average time t to use ult + expected kills at t
