*"Quantitative finance is the use of mathematical models and extremely
large datasets to analyze financial markets and securities"*

Like the name suggests, quantitative finance is all about using data to quantify financial trends.
The goal of a quant (Someone who performs quantitative analysis) is to create models that
predict these trends and utitlize them to generate trading strategies.

At first glance quantitative finance seems completely unrelated to gaming, but the data
generated by both of them is quite similar and many of the techniques used in quantitative
finance seem very applicable to gaming.

If you're not familiar with quantitative finance, don't worry. I'll keep it high level and understandable.

## Predicting Financial Markets

Traditional quantitative finance techniques heavily revolve around time series analysis, since
that is the format financial data tends to be in (E.g. a chronological list of stock prices).

There are a number of different methods you can use to analyze time series data, but they all
revolve around the same general ideas. Namely, decomposing trends (E.g. linear, seasonal, etc)
and fitting a model based on the mean, variance and previous data points in the time series.

These methods are robust to variations in the mean and variance, meaning that many different time series
can be modelled using these methods. This might make it seem like it should be easy to create
accurate predictions, but there are other issues with predicting financial markets.

One problem is limited historical data. Since we can't access alternate realities (Yet), there
is only ever one realization of the time series (I.e. reality). This also makes forecasting (I.e. future prediction)
tricky because time series are inherently stochastic (I.e. random). So while your model may accurately
predict the time series over many realizations, any individual realization can vary significantly.

Another problem is that quants care about generating returns, so simply predicting a time series
is not that useful. They have to be able to make money with the strategy while taking multiple other factors
into account such as managing risk, trading fees, overall portfolio construction/optimization,
entry and exit positions, etc.

There's also the paradoxical situation where by executing your strategy you end up affecting
the market and nullifying your predictions.

This is all to say that predicting financial markets is very complicated for various reasons.

Luckily, video games are significantly simpler.

## Gaming and Financial Markets

If we think about what happens over the course of a game, it's quite similar to financial data.
Players generally have resources which are effectively stochastic processes that may trend
linearly or cyclically over time. For example, a player's Resource Collection Rate in
StarCraft 2 or their Gold in Dota 2.

Game data is also arguably far easier to analyze for a few reasons:

- There are no external factors affecting the variables (E.g. world events)
- Games are likely to be more standardized than financial markets
- There are many realizations (I.e. matches) we can use for analysis

We also don't have to worry about the pesky details that I mentioned
earlier like making money or managing risk.

Another great thing about gaming is that unlike financial data,
many games have large amounts of easily accessible, fairly rich game data. We also don't
have the problem of only one true realization of the time series because we probably
don't care that much about any particular match as long as we can accurately predict trends
over many matches.

There is one obvious downside of game data though. Financial data is very straightforward.
You have a price, it goes up and down. End of story. Games are not so simple.

The point of a game is to win, but the outcome of a match is generally the product of
a large number of variables interacting in complex ways throughout the match.

To generate any meaningful models, we will need to formulate useful questions about the game
and select the variables that best model those questions. Though you could actually say that
this is a strength of game data since we have far more flexbility!

## Future Analysis

In future posts I will be analyzing StarCraft 2 time series data to see
if I can fit the data to a model and extract some meaningful trends from it. If that
proves to be successful the next step will be to try simulating and predicting games
with the traditional time series model and explore the possibility of utilizing
Deep Learning (Specifically LSTMs) for multivariate predictions.
