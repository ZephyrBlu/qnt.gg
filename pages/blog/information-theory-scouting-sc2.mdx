*Update: Entropy is specifically related to probability distributions.
Calculations for individual events relate to **information content** (I.e. Shannon Information)
not entropy. The post has been updated to reflect this.*

Depending on your background, your first reaction to the title may have ranged from "I know some of those words"
to "this makes no sense". Either way, in a few paragraphs it will (Hopefully) make perfect sense so don't sweat it!

First, I'll explain the small piece of Information Theory we're going to utilize
(Shannon Information) and the idea I had to apply it to StarCraft 2 (SC2).

Then I'll walk through actually applying the idea in practice and what the preliminary
results looked like.

Lastly, I'll go through some possible improvements of my method and other applications of the idea.

## Shannon Information

Information Theory is all about quantifying information, and it has numerous applications in areas
such as error correction, compression and cryptography.

One of *the* core ideas in Information Theory is the concept of information content (A.k.a Shannon Information),
which is equivalent self-information or surprise.

The idea is that the more surprising an event is, the more information it has. Let's compare
the outcomes of an unfair coin to see why this makes sense.

    # unfair coin
    P(Tails) = 0.9, P(Heads) = 0.1

If we flip the unfair coin, we expect that it will land on Tails because that's the most likely
outcome. However, if the unfair coin lands on Heads instead it's pretty surprising.

This is reflected in the Shannon Information of these outcomes. The Heads event has a much larger
value than the Tails event. Speaking of which, the equation for Shannon Information that we will be using is as follows:

    # log base 2
    I(X) = -log2(P(x))

Where `P(x)` is the probability of `x` occurring. I'm not going to explain this equation, but the TL;DR
is that high probability = low information and vice versa. This is also the equation for a single
event, not a probability distribution.

If you'd like to read more about Shannon Information you can find information on [it's wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_content).
For information content in probability distributions (I.e. Entropy) [this is the page you want to look at](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)).

Relating this back to information, we can view surprise as information because if an unsurprising
event occurs we haven't gained much information since we already knew it was likely to occur, and vice
versa for surprising events.

A common application of Shannon Information is measuring the information content of text.
We can measure the frequency of different words or letters, then create probabilities based on those frequencies
and calculate how much information some text contains.

An example of this is using the alphabet as our source of frequency/probability and measuring
the information content of some text. Another example is using a whole pile of books as the source
of frequency/probability for words, then measuring the information content of a book.

## Measuring Information Content in StarCraft 2

So how does this relate to scouting? Well, scouting is about gathering information.
Maybe if we can quantify the amount of information in the game at each point in time then we
can figure out when there's a lot of new information being created, and that seems like good time to scout.

Figuring out what build your opponent is doing is generally a pretty important piece of
information, so we'll start by trying to measure the information content of that (I'll talk about units later).

If we think about what a build is it's just a list of buildings, which is literally the same
thing as a list of words. We can measure the frequency of each building over many games, then
calculate probabilities based on those frequencies and use those to calculate the
information content of each building in a particular game.

Then we can plot the information content of each building against time and judge if it's a good time to scout
based on the relative information content of each building. High information content relative to other buildings
indicates a surprising event occured, so we might want to scout what happened.

## Calculating Information Content from IEM Katowice Games

As per the heading of this section, I used all the games from IEM Katowice for this analysis.

First, I made a list of buildings to ignore when counting frequencies since I thought they would
negatively affect the interpretability of information content. I eliminated supply buildings (Pylon, Supply Depot),
gas collectors and some support buildings like Missile Turrets and Cannons.

This is the full list of buildings I ignored:

    IGNORE_OBJECTS = [
        'Pylon',
        'Overlord',
        'SupplyDepot',
        'MissileTurret',
        'SensorTower',
        'SpineCrawler',
        'SporeCrawler',
        'PhotonCannon',
        'Interceptor',
        'MULE',
        'AutoTurret',
        'Larva',
        'Egg',
        'LocustMP',
        'LocustMPPrecursor',
        'LocustMPFlying',
        'ShieldBattery',
        'Bunker',
        'CreepTumor',
        'CreepTumorQueen',
        'CreepTumorBurrowed',
        'Broodling',
        'BroodlingEscort',
        'NydusCanal',

        # remove gas buildings and workers to reduce noise
        'Extractor',
        'Assimilator',
        'Refinery',
        'Probe',
        'Drone',
        'SCV',
    ]

And here's a quick breakdown of my reasoning for eliminating each of these types:

---

### Supply Buildings

Supply buildings are so abundant that including them would heavily affect the frequency of all
buildings. We also don't generally care that much about supply buildings, so it seems like a lot
of noise for little information.

### Gas Collectors

At first I included gas collectors in the analysis, but I found that they were too common and
although gas timings can be important, any given gas collector is **not** important so I scrapped them.

### Support Buildings

Because this analysis is focused on scouting, I thought that removing these buildings would reduce
the amount of noise since we generally don't care about these types of buildings when we're scouting.

There is the case where someone is turtling and making a lot of these buildings, but I'm not
sure if the benefit of accounting for this case outweighs the disadvantage of creating more noise
for other scenarios.

---

After removing these buildings I calculated building frequencies on a per matchup basis to try and increase accuracy,
then converted the frequencies to probabilities.

To test out my theory in practice I generated information content values for the Finals games between Reynor and Zest,
RO4 games between Reynor and Maru and RO8 games between TY and PartinG and gave the values
a cursory check to see if they made any sort of sense.

Looking at the values, they actually seemed to line up well! Buildings that you would naturally
think are more important such as tech choices had much higher entropies than generic production buildings.
Right now I haven't charted these values so I have nothing to show yet,
**<span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>but I plan to visualize this soon</span>**.

An interesting unexpected result that I didn't think about is Terran add-ons being counted as
a unique building + add-on pair (E.g. `StarportReactor`). Since these combinations are
relatively rare compared to other buildings they tend to have quite high information content, which
feels like a relatively good indicator when you think about it because add-on choice is actually
quite important and can signal different builds!

## Improvements and Future Applications

The main issue I see with the current methodology is naively calculating frequencies based on
the overall game. A couple of ideas for mitigating this are analyzing frequency based on time and analyzing frequency
conditional to tech requirements being met.

For time-based frequency, this could be achieved by batching time into discrete 30sec periods
and then analyzing the frequency of buildings in these periods. This may help identify activity
which is build/time dependent such as non-standard builds or aggressive timings.

For frequency based on tech requirements, this could be achieved by creating dependencies for
each building which include the required tech buildings and record building frequencies
in the periods between when new tech buildings were created. While probably more 'correct',
this seems like quite a convoluted and complex solution.

On the other side of things, an obvious application is units/army. The issue is that
units serve quite a different purpose to buildings. Buildings tend to be an investment, whereas
units are disposable.

A possible approach to analyzing unit information content is to measure frequencies across the entire game,
but to batch them based into discrete 30sec periods. The idea here is to find points in time
when players suddenly produce many surprising units, which might mean you want to scout them
and see if they are planning an attack or turtling up.

This is similar to batching by supply or army value, but the difference is that we are
judging the units on how surprising it would be to see them. You wouldn't be surprised if a Protoss
was making Archons and Immortals regardless of their high supply and resource cost, but you might
be in for a rude surprise if you didn't scout something like a fleet of Carriers, Void Rays or Phoenix!
This approach may also benefit from the proposed batched frequency improvement. 

Another possible application of information content to units/army is a measurement such as information content per unit/resource/supply.
Perhaps this could be an informative and interpretable way to measure and compare unit compositions
since it effectively normalizes across all units instead of trying to compare apples to oranges.

I'm excited to see where this goes since I think general idea of information content is
extremely flexible and applicable to many different areas of both SC2 and other games.
