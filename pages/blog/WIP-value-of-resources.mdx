StarCraft 2 players intuitively understand the value of resources and that it's optimal to spend them
efficiently, but how much does it really cost to bank resources?

We'll answer this question by analyzing Resource Collection Rate, applying an idea from the concept
of Time Value of Money and then analyzing some pro games.

## The Time Value of Money

This concept is very intuitive, you'd rather have money now than
later because of things like interest and the ability to invest the money.

The equation for Time Value of Money is as follows:

    Vp = Vf / (1 + r)

Where `Vp` is the present value, `Vf` is the future value and `r` is the discount rate. Discount rate
is usually the interest rate, but for us it will obviously be something else.

Although there's no interest in StarCraft 2 and the Time Value of Money does not directly apply,
the idea of a discount rate is still useful.

To create a discount rate we have to account for the expected future value of resources.
The way I chose to approach this is through change in Resource Collection Rate:

    r = (Rt / Rt-1) - 1

Where `r` is the discount rate and `Rt` is the Resource Collection Rate at time `t`.
This calculates the percentage change in Resource Collection Rate from the last data point
to the current data point.

What this means is that we expect the value of our resources to be `r%` more or less valuable
at `t+1` because our Resource Collection Rate will have theoretically increased or decreased
by `r%`.

This isn't to say that we don't value resources themselves more or less, but that the relative value of 
our resources changes since it's easier or harder for us to earn the same amount of resources.
Perhaps it used to take us 10 seconds to earn 1000 Minerals and now it takes us 6 seconds, or vice versa.

## Time to Mine

The most common way to analyze banked resources is, well, Unspent Resources. But I don't
think this is the most useful way to think about banked resources.

I think a more intuitive approach is to convert Unspent Resources to Time to Mine, where Time
to Mine is as follows:

    Time to Mine = (Resource Collection Rate / 60) / Unspent Resources

It represents exactly what the name suggests. The time (In seconds) it would take you to mine your current
Unspent Resources, given your current Resource Collection Rate. Resource Collection Rate is
divided by 60 since it's measured per minute, whereas Time to Mine is measured per second.

This accounts for situations where it's ok to bank resources because you have an insanely
high Resource Collection Rate and makes your Unspent Resources more interpretable.

## Putting It All Together

Combining this with our discount rate, we can get a more accurate idea of how badly our
Unspent Resources are burning a hole in our pocket during a game.

    Discounted Unspent Resources = Discount Rate * Time to Mine
