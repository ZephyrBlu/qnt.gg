## In The Beginning

For a couple of years now I've been focusing my energy on thinking about how to
analyze StarCraft 2 (SC2).

[I built tooling](https://github.com/ZephyrBlu/zephyrus-sc2-parser) to help me
extract data from games, created [my own analysis website](https://zephyrus.gg)
and have shared many different experimental analyses with the SC2 community
on the /r/starcraft subreddit.

At first it was just for fun because I like playing around with data, but in the last year
I've tried to hone in on how I can help players intuitively understand the game and
how to improve.

This is a tough problem. SC2 is complicated and highly contextual. Even giving advice to other
players can be difficult because of the large amount of caveats based on the situation.

Traditionally, analysis of video games in general has been limited to basic summary statistics of the game.
Analysis websites basically give you a spreadsheet of numbers and it's up to you to work things out.
Needless to say, this isn't very helpful.

But how can we improve this?

## The Problem 

First of all, why *aren't* summary statistics good enough?

I think the main reason is **context**, or lack thereof. SC2 is highly contextual and a
large component of skill is **game sense** (I.e. being able to read the state of the game).

A few numbers summarizing the game has almost *zero* context, so it's very hard to derive
meaningful insights from the them. This is why the recommended approach for players trying to
improve is to **analyze their replays**.

When you watch a replay, you have the full context of the game. You can see that 6 minutes into
the game you only had 30 workers, which makes the fact that you produced a total of 100 workers irrelevant!

So on the context spectrum we now have summary statistics (**Low context**), and on the other hand
we have replays (**High context**).

However, in some ways we have traded our original problem for a new one. If you've ever tried to "git gud"
at something, you will have experienced the feeling of not knowing what you're doing wrong.
You know you suck ([Or maybe you don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)),
but you don't know what you have to do to improve.

Context is great, but only if you have the **game sense** to interpret it. Without a base level of game knowledge
it's hard to pinpoint where things went wrong in a game, even if you watch the replay. It's not uncommon to see players
ask something along the lines of, "what do I look for when I'm analyzing my replays?".

This is because the context of a game is noisy. There are a lot of things happening, but only a few of those things
are important for analyzing your games. We need to strike a balance between the **high context** of games and
the **low context** of raw numbers, while presenting the contextual information in an understandable manner.

## High Skill vs Low Skill

So far we've discussed making analysis more accessible for players who don't already have strong game sense,
but what about high level players with strong game sense?

Once you reach a certain level, consistency becomes very important. Hard to judge over singular games, need large sample
