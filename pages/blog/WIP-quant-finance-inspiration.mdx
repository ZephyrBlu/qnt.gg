*"Quantitative finance is the use of mathematical models and extremely
large datasets to analyze financial markets and securities"*

Like the name suggests, quant finance is all about using data to quantify financial trends.
The goal of a quant (Someone who performs quantitative analysis) is to create models that
predict these trends, and utitlize them to generate trading strategies.

At first glance quant finance seems completely unrelated to gaming, but after
looking at gaming from a slightly different perspective you might find that
they're more similar than you thought.

If you're not familiar with quant finance, don't worry. I'll keep it high level and understandable.

## Predicting Financial Markets

Traditional quantitative finance techniques heavily revolve around time series analysis, since
that is the format financial data tends to be in (E.g. a chronological list of stock prices).

There are a number of different methods you can use to analyze time series data, but they all
revolve around the same general ideas. Namely, decomposing trends (E.g. linear, seasonal, etc)
and fitting a model based on the mean, variance and previous data points in the time series.

These methods are robust to variations to the mean and variance, meaning that many different time series
can be modelled using these methods. This might make it seem like it should be easy to create
accurate predictions, but there are other issues with predicting financial markets.

One problem is limited historical data. Since we can't access alternate realities (Yet), there
is only ever one realization of the time series (I.e. reality). This also makes forecasting (I.e. future prediction)
tricky because time series are inherently stochastic (I.e. random), so while your model may accurately
predict the time series over many realizations any single realization may vary significantly.

Another problem is that quants care about generating returns, so simply predicting a time series
is not that useful. They have to be able to make money while also taking multiple other factors
into account such as trading fees, overall portfolio construction, entry and exit positions, etc.

There's also the paradoxical situation where by executing your strategy, you end up affecting
the market and nullifying your predictions.

This is all to say that predicting financial markets is very complicated for various reasons.

Luckily, video games are significantly simpler.
