- Replay analysis from first principles
- Why?
 - To find mistakes. Why?
  - To learn from mistakes. Why?
   - less mistakes = higher chance to win game
   - Constantly iterate on this. Make mistakes, learn, repeat. Fast feedback cycle
 - To identify poor decision making/mechanics
  - 2 core components of skill are mechanics and decision making
  - After base level of mechanical skill, decision making is usually the most important
  - Mechanics-wise: can see where more improvement is needed and do focused practice
    - Usually easy to spot since quite deterministic
  - Decision-wise: identify costly decisions and think about how to improve decision making
   - Usually highly contextual and can be hard to pinpoint the root issue
