## In The Beginning

For a couple of years now I've been focusing my energy on thinking about how to
analyze StarCraft 2 (SC2).

[I built tooling](https://github.com/ZephyrBlu/zephyrus-sc2-parser) to help me
extract data from games, created [my own analysis website](https://zephyrus.gg)
and have shared many different experimental analyses with the SC2 community
on the /r/starcraft subreddit.

At first it was just for fun because I like playing around with data, but in the last year
I've tried to hone in on how I can help players intuitively understand the game and
how to improve.

This is a tough problem. SC2 is complicated and highly contextual. Giving advice to other
players can be difficult because of the large amount of caveats based on the situation.

Traditionally, analysis for video games has been limited to basic summary statistics.
Analysis websites basically give you a spreadsheet of numbers and it's up to you to work things out.
Needless to say, this isn't very helpful.

But how can we improve this?

## The Problem 

First of all, why *aren't* summary statistics good enough?

I think the main reason is **context**, or lack thereof. SC2 is highly contextual and a
large component of skill is **game sense** (I.e. being able to read the state of the game).

A few numbers summarizing the game has almost *zero* context, so it's very hard to derive
meaningful insights from the them. This is why the recommended approach for players trying to
improve is to **analyze their replays**.

When you watch a replay, you have the full context of the game. You can see that 6 minutes into
the game you only had 30 workers, which makes the fact that you produced a total of 100 workers irrelevant!

So on one end of the context spectrum we have summary statistics (**Low context**), and on the other end
we have replays (**High context**).

However, in some ways we have traded our original problem for a new one. If you've ever tried to "git gud"
at something, you will have experienced the feeling of not knowing what you're doing wrong.
You know you suck ([Or maybe you don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)),
but you don't know what you have to do to improve.

Context is great, but only if you have the game sense to interpret it. Without a base level of
game knowledge it's hard to pinpoint where things went wrong in a game, even if you watch the replay.
It's not uncommon to see players ask something along the lines of, "what do I look for when I'm analyzing my replays?".

This is because the context of a game is noisy. There are a lot of things happening, but only a few of those things
are important for analyzing your games. We need to strike a balance between the **high context** of games and
the **low context** of raw numbers, while presenting the information in an understandable manner.

## Another Problem: Consistency

So far I've discussed making contextual information more accessible for players who don't
already have much game sense, but what about mid skill players who have *some* game sense
and high skill players with strong game sense?

Along with context, another important aspect of SC2 is **consistency**. Once you reach a
particular skill level, the consistency of your execution becomes extremely important.

Though paradoxically once consistency becomes important, being able to filter highly contextual
information becomes less useful. To improve your consistency, you have to analyze your play
over *many* games so being able to understand what went wrong in any particular game is not
as useful.

If you play 10 games then analyze them and find different mistakes in each game, how do you
decide which mistake to focus on fixing? The large number of possible strategies in the game
makes this situation quite common.

The only approach I've seen to improving your consistency is to choose a specific area of
the game to focus on and make that your sole objective, then repeat this. This does work,
but it can be hard to figure out what the most important areas of your play to focus on are.

## Solutions

All of this talk is great, but what really matters is getting shit done. So here are some ideas
I'm actively refining and implementing to present highly contextual information in an
understandable way, and to analyze the consistency of players over many games.

### Context

- Default to charting stats over time to preserve context
- Provide comprehensive information about the game state to preserve context
- Make hidden information such as worker production queues and Creep Tumors Killed accessible

### Consistency

- Show distributions of stats over many games rather than average numbers
    - Allows players to visually see how consistent they are

- Aggregate time series data (I.e. game timelines) across many games to find player tendencies while preserving contextual information
    - **Tendencies**
        - What time in the game do you tend to be supply blocked?
        - What time in the game do you tend to float resources?

    - **Context**
        - When you're supply blocked/floating resources, what happened in the previous few seconds?
            - What units/buildings died?
            - What units/buildings were created?
            - Which units/buildings did you select?

- Use Time Series and Deep Learning techniques to simulate games
    - Specifically, ARIMA/GARCH and LSTMs
    - Simulate large amounts of games to analyze player tendencies
    - Simulate playouts of games to determine when a player lost/gained an advantage
