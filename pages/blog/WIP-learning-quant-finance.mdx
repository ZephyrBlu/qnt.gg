For a couple of years now I've been focusing my energy on thinking about how to
analyze video games, specifically StarCraft 2 (SC2).

[I built tooling](https://github.com/ZephyrBlu/zephyrus-sc2-parser) to help me
extract data from games, created [my own analysis website](https://zephyrus.gg)
and have shared many different experimental analyses with the SC2 community
on the /r/starcraft subreddit.

At first it was just for fun because I like playing around with data, but more recently
I've been thinking a lot about how I can help players intuitively understand the game and
how to improve.

This is a tough problem. SC2 is complicated and highly contextual. Even giving advice to other
players can be difficult because of the large amount of caveats based on the situation.
